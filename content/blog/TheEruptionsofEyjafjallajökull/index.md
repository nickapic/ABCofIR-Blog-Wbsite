However, the lessons learned from this security or safety challenge must not be left out, or the analysis will be incomplete. That is why the method Explore-Understand-Do is one of the most used. Here is a case using that simple method."

Exploration

The eruptions of the volcano Eyjafjallajökull in 2010 were a safety issue with a global impact. They were small volcanic eruptions which caused enormous disruption to air travel and to the lives of the locals during six days in the month of April, more particularly, from the 14th to the 20th. Eyjafjallajökull is one of Iceland’s smaller ice caps located in the south of the island. These volcanic events were considered to be a single eruption divided into different phases that will be analyzed in detail.

Let’s begin with the first phase, from the 20th of March to the 12th of April. The Effusive Eruption. There was an initial visual report the first day at 23:52 of a red cloud. A fissure had opened up of about 150 meters with around 10 lava craters ejecting lava. During the year prior, 2009, there was a higher seismic activity which concluded this 20th of March 2010 when the first small eruption began, only a 1 on the volcanic explosivity index.
The 25 of March, while studying the eruption, scientists witnessed for the first time in history the formation of a pseudocrater during a steam explosion. The 14th of April a new phase started, named the Explosive Eruption.
This 13th of April, there was a large increase on seismic activity at 23:00.  On the 14th evacuation of the locals started when a new set of craters opened up causing earthquakes followed by an onset of a seismic eruption tremor. This eruption caused melting of large amounts of ice, leading to a massive flooding in southern Iceland.

The interaction of the magma with the water created a plume of volcano as and gas, which spreaded out. This ash cloud provoked the closure of most of the European IFR airspace from the 15ht to the 20th of April.
On Sunday, 18th, researchers from the University of Iceland estimated that 750 tonnes of magma were ejected from the volcano. By the 20th of April most of the ice in the crater appeared to have melted, the plume was now reaching heights of 4 km, in comparison with the 9 km that were reached during the first day.

At this point the volcano changed from producing ash to mainly fire fountains. This second phase occurred beneath the glacial ice, but the location of this eruption was directly under the jet stream ensuring that the ash was carried into the heavily used airspace. The third and last phase of this timeline is the Return to dormancy.

Already on the 24th of May, view from a web camera installed showed only a plume of water vapour surrounded by a bluish haze. On October 2010 the eruption was declared officially over. Concerning now on the different perspectives among which we need to analyse this case:

Regarding the multilevel perspective, it is clear that three levels are recognized. Starting with the national level, with local security evacuating people, being in essence a national issue of a volcano on the territory of a particular state, Iceland.

Concerning the local level, of course the people from the south were the most affected by it and by the evacuations, plus being the local government the one that took charge of the organization to prevent casualties. It is important to highlight as well the international level because the consequences of this terrible situation not only affected people living in Iceland, but due to the ash cloud many other countries, mostly in the regional area of Europe, where affected in some degree.

Now regarding the multi actor perspective, it is obvious that plenty of actors took place on trying to solve and reacting to this situation. Government actors, such as the government of Iceland and national responses taken to tackle the issue, plus societal actors, such as individuals that left their location and their houses. Dealing with the consequences, it was a matter of local and national governments, particular societal actors such as individuals and businesses, and international with other governments also being affected.

Understanding

Economic perspective. In this case it focuses on how the economy was affected by this problematic issue. The most direct casualty of the ash is the airline industry.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that airlines are collectively losing £130m per day in lost revenues.Travel companies are also losing out. TUI, the owner of First Choice and Thomson and Europe's biggest travel operator, says it is losing between £5m and £6m a day. The Prime Minister Gordon Brown admitted the problem was so serious that financial help for airlines would be considered.

Over 100,000 flights were cancelled over that week, affecting 7 million passengers, and resulting in \$1.7 billion USD in lost revenue to airlines according to an analysis by Oxford Economics.
The impact on the tourism industry is expected to be relatively small, if the disruption lasts no longer than a few days.Although the tourism industry will lose money from customers unable to make the trip, stranded passengers unable to return home will also be forced to spend more money than expected - offsetting some of those losses. International trade relies more on heavily on road, rail, and sea freight.

But the disruption has provoked real issues for people trading perishable goods, among them food and flowers, which mainly depend on air transportation. For example, food exports from Africa and The Caribbean are among those hit, with reports coming from Kenya, where its farmers are being forced to dump stocks of goods destined for the European market. Obviously some businesses lost money as well through cancelled meetings, stranded staff, and delays. Major courier companies FedEx, DHL, and TNT reported delays and disruption on the affected places.

Public safety perspective. In this case it focuses on how the public and locals were affected by this safety hazard, what was done to protect them, how were they informed and taken care of, and the consequences of this situation on their health.

The Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull exposed residents in southern Iceland to continuous ash fall for more than 5 weeks in spring 2010. There was a study conducted during November 2010-March 2011, 6-9 months after the Eyjafjallajökull eruption, on the health effects following the eruption. The likelihood of having symptoms during the last month was higher in the exposed population, such as; tightness in the chest, cough, phlegm and eye irritation. Adults (n=26) and children (n=5) with pre-existing asthma frequently reported worsening of their symptoms.The majority of the participants reported no abnormal physical or mental symptoms to the examining physician.
As a conclusion, on short-term ash exposure was associated with upper airway irritation symptoms and exacerbation of pre-existing asthma but did not contribute to serious health problems. The exposure did not impair respiratory function compared to controls. Outdoor use of protective glasses and face masks was considered protective against irritation in eyes and upper airway.

Doing

As in every crisis in Iceland, the Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management also called DCPEM, facilitated crisis communication while collaborating with the Icelandic Meteorological Office, the Institute of Earth Sciences at the University of Iceland and the National Crisis Coordination Centre. Its role included providing information to the government and its various agencies and feeding information from scientists to local police officials, civil protection committees and the public.

Representatives from all the levels form the Civil Protection and Security Council, which sets strategies relating to civil protection, security and emergency management for the nation for 3-years at a time. This includes developing and implementing strategies to prevent and/or mitigate physical injury, impacts on public health and damage to the environment and property, in addition to providing emergency relief and assistance.
Communication with local residents took place through agencies’ websites, the national media and frequent open town hall meetings where representatives of institutions responsible for eruption monitoring, health, safety and livestock handling provided advice, and this face to face meetings were vital and critical. There had not been these type of issues and hazards for sixty years, plus plans dealing with volcanoes were not established. The trust built between all above mentioned above with the citizens increased the effectiveness of the crisis communication and a rapid reaction from the main criticism towards the coordination was in relation to lack of planning, with some residents stating that they were confused about who was to go where.

In our area the planning for the evacuation and the evacuation centre was not good, it should have been planned better. As soon as the eruption site was located in the early morning on the flank of Eyjafjallajökull and not under the ice-cap, residents were allowed to return to their homes.

The lesson learned from this experience is important for all types of volcanic crisis communication at local and international level. The immediate evacuation plans were effective, what this showed was more need of preparation for strategies and precautions.
