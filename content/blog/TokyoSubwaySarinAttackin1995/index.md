The Tokyo subway sarin attack was an act of domestic terrorism perpetrated on March 20, 1995, in Tokyo, Japan, by members of the cult movement Aum Shinrikyo. In five coordinated attacks, 5 perpetrators released sarin on three lines of the Tokyo subway during rush hour, killing 12 people, severely injuring 50 and causing temporary vision problems for nearly 5,000 others.

The attack was directed against trains passing through Kasumigaseki and Nagatachō, home to the Japanese government. Until the Myojo 56 building fire on September 1, 2001, it was the deadliest incident to occur in Japan since the end of World War II. The chemical agent used, liquid sarin, was contained in plastic bags which each team then wrapped in newspaper. Carrying their packets of sarin and umbrellas with sharpened tips, the perpetrators boarded their appointed trains.

The attackers were well educated people in: Physics, Doctor and Artificial Intelligence. On the day of the attack, ambulances transported 688 patients and nearly five thousand people reached hospitals by other means. Hospitals saw 5,510 patients, seventeen of whom were deemed critical, thirty-seven severe and 984 moderately ill with vision problems. Most of those reporting to hospitals were the "worried well", who had to be distinguished from those who were ill.

Timeline of events

Two years before the attack, Aum attempted to eliminate the, according to him, corrupt Royal Family, by throwing from the back of a Van botulinum toxin spray near the imperial palace alleging moral superiority. By 27 June 1994, Aum Shinrikyo first began their attacks in Matsumoto, Japan. Members of the cult released a cloud of sarin which floated near the homes of judges who were overseeing a lawsuit concerning a real-estate dispute which was predicted to go against the cult.

From this one event, 500 people were injured and 8 people died. By March 18th, 1995, two days before the attack, 2 members of the Japan Army, and Aum disciple revealed the Organization the Police was going to raid into Aum premises due to complaints presented against them, but they tried to turn away the search thinking the Police would only focus on the new attack and will forget about Aum affairs.

Between 07:46-08:00 five terrorists get onboard the main lines of the Tokyo subway with liquid sarin gas. At 08:00, the gas is released simultaneously by the 5 terrorists and spread within several stations. By 08:46, one hour after the attack, Japan know the news about the attack. At 10:30 a military physician diagnoses Sarin intoxication.

At 13:30 it was send chemical weapon expert accompany by approx. 100 soldiers. Two days after de attack, the 2500 Police Agents raid 25 settings of Aum in all Japan. Aum had helicopters from Russia. There they seized documents, people and chemical materials, it was also found the chemical deposit of sarin gas Aum had.

May 16th, 1995, Asahara was detained and condemned to the death penalty after an 8 years’ trial. Between May and July, Aum made 4 more frustrated attempts of attack in the Tokyo Subway Context.

The attack was perpetrated in a context following the Cold War when Japan though everything happening there was perpetrated by North Korea. Thus, this particular idea of Cultural factor had blinded the Police and intelligence agencies, because they thought that religious organizations were untouchable and they must be careful acting against them.

Multi Actor Perspective

The government actors involved in the attack were, the Emergency Services including- Police (providing security and organization at the scene of the incident, and investigating potential suspects), Fire (providing personnel and transportation to assist during the aftermath of the attack), Ambulance Services (transporting people to Hospital for further treatment), Military (aiding chemical weapons expert of the attack).

The Ministry of Health Services by authorizing the transportation of sarin antidote from rural hospitals for victim’s treatment. And the subway authorities, which were involved and suffered the impact of the attacks since the beginning.
Public Opinion: The Media for example was not wanted at the subway entrances trying to film the victims and investigating the real causes of the event, before the official releases one hour after the attack.

The NGO: By May 1995, an American NGO named American Scholars, flew to Japan to hold press conferences in which they announced that the chief suspect in the murders, religious group Aum Shinrikyo, could not have produced the sarin that the attacks had been committed with. They had determined this from photos and documents provided by the group.

Private Actors and Business were impacted in the measure people were not able to go to work and the reduction of some commercial activities due to the aftermath of the attack.

Multi-Level perspective: Because of the attack, several levels of the Japanese government were involved. National Level, including the information provided by the intelligence agency on Aum Groups. The Military, by helping chemical experts after the attack and supporting the Police with valuable information. The Ministry of Health services, by providing sarin antidote taken from rural hospital due to urban hospital didn’t have in stock. Local Level, involving the Firefighters, Medical Services, Local Police, Ambulance Services, the Subway authority all of them responding to the attack with the information they manage at that time. And finally, the individuals who were affected during the attack because of they were just passengers on the subway or because they engage in helping others when the gas initiated to affect people’s health.

UNDERSTAND

Counter-terrorism Perspective:
Learning from the Tokyo attack under the counter-terrorism perspective reflects that the Japanese Intelligence Agency and Law Enforcement Agencies needed change to prevent later possible attacks. As they have had several minor terrorists like attacks in the last two years, if this was not North Korea (who was blamed for everything under those circumstances), more investigations towards the actual perpetrators were necessary.

Recent terrorist activities: Two years before the attack, Aum attempts to eliminate the according to him the corrupt Royal Family by throwing from the back of a Van botulinum toxin spray near the imperial palace alleging moral superiority. By 27 June 1994, Aum Shinrikyo first began their attacks in Matsumoto, Japan. Members of the cult released a cloud of sarin which floated near the homes of judges who were overseeing a lawsuit concerning a real-estate dispute which was predicted to go against the cult. From this one event, 500 people were injured and 8 people died.

One month before the attack there had been several accusations against Aum saying telling they committed the 1994 Matsumoto attack, and the Police received an intelligence information from anonymous, telling that Aum committed the Sarin attack because they have the men, resources, materials, and motives to perpetrate such weapon.

With all that information on their hands, some more questions and more investigations towards this religious group should have been organized, while monitoring their acts, circumstances, and plans. The Japanese Officials were blinded with the thinking of North Korea being the responsible for every suspected terrorist’s activity, but there was enough evidence that appoint to Aum as the mastermind of something else.

It is also very concerning that in a country like Japan, a suppose religious organization can acquire, store, develop and manufacture such elements without calling the attention of the Intelligence and Law enforcement authorities, even provided that sometimes people complaint about the method they used to clean people and children from the evil society and become an Aum believer.

In summary, one large lesson learned for the Government authorities, because unfortunately at that moment they were not able to control this organization as they did not have the necessary strategies to suspect and track them. They did not realize of their motives, radicalization and prevention of the potential attack.

Crisis communication Perspective: The communication during the event was not ideal; while the media was trying to gather information on what had happened, at the same time several people were asking for help to members of the media and they refused to help in many cases. But in terms of authorities, not many knew how to act in the event of a crisis like this.

It was at 10:30, more than 2 hours later, that the attack was confirmed as “Sarin Gas Attack”, and during all that time, so many people were exposed to the chemical without awareness of what happened. Thus, none of the government first responder in a crisis knew about Sarin gas (Subway authority, Police, Medical Personnel, others), and even worse, the urban hospital didn’t have stock of sarin antidote because there was no use of pesticides in the urbanized cities.

This is another bug within the government agencies, provided that in Japan there have been previous chemical attacks in the recent past before the Tokyo one (see timeline). One University Professor who saw the victim’s symptoms by TV, shed light on the medical authorities and faxed it regarding the sarin gas. In summary, the public knew about the incident more than 2 hours after the attack. There was a great state of confusion among the government officials on what really happens and how to treat the symptoms.

DO

Actions taken by the actor involved and their objectives:

The victims of the attacks, one passenger held the emergency break after feeling bad due to the gas attack, done to call the attention of the subway crew and ask for help. The subway authority (chief operator & crew) were to blame because they failed to halt several of the trains despite reports of passenger injured and sick, allowing the chemical to stay and spread further into the subway.

Also, some of the crew members of the subway suffered from serious effects. Health services, including hospitals and health staff in one hospital refused to admit a victim for almost an hour, and many hospitals turned victims away. Tokyo hospitals also fall short of sarin antidote. The Police could have prevented the attack due to in the last month there had been several accusations against Aum telling they committed the 1994 Matsumoto attack, and the Police received anonymous information, telling that Aum committed the Sarin attack because they have the men, resources, materials, and motives to perpetrate such weapon.

There was a massive prosecution of Aum members, and the Police departed 2500 Agents to raid 25 settings of Aum in all Japan. They seized helicopters, documents, people and chemical materials. More than 400 Aum members were arrested.

The Intelligence agency cooperated with law enforcement authorities to identify the location of various Aum members that were wanted by the prosecutors. The Japanese Diet (Parliament), shortly after the attack, removed Aum its status as a religious organization, and many of its assets were seized. The National Public Safety Commission received increased funding to monitor the group. They didn’t ban the group because it could have created some sense of illegality in the members and they could potentially dedicate to terrorist activist looking for revenge against the government actions.

In 1999, the Diet gave the commission broad powers to monitor and curtail the activities of groups that have been involved in "indiscriminate mass murder" and whose leaders are "holding strong sway over their members", a bill custom-tailored to Aum Shinrikyo.

It prevents future terrorist activities because Security Agencies will maintain looking at their activities, methods, radical ideas, among other things. Firefighters, chemical experts and Military also contributed to solve the problem created by the attack.

Lessons Learned

• The intelligence and Law enforcement agencies must understand that every organization that spread supremacist and radical ideas are prone to engage or commit terrorist acts. They should be monitored along with their member’s activities.

• Japan understood that the old myth of religious organizations been untouchable is over. They had enough information to stop the attack but were too cautious to act.

• The Police received anonymous intelligence information on Aum’s engagement in past terrorist acts, but didn’t act on time to stop the attack that took place by March 20th

• The subway authorities must develop specific security and safety procedures to manage suspicious packages and general crisis.

• The ambulance services collapsed because of the quantity of people asking for the service.

• The Ministry of Health Services must think about the various types of antidotes and information they should manage to be prepare for responding a terrorist attack.
