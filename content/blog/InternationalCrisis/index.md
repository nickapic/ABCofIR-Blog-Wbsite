One prominent feature of our world is the occurrence of international crises. While the Middle East immediately comes to mind, it is just an example in the long list that encompasses these events.

The importance of international crisis is highly recognized in the media, as well as its significance for governments, international actors, and people. Nevertheless, it is a very broad topic, and the specific components that constitute a crises of an international character.
Despite the frequency in which they occur within our international system, little is known about their process; however, in recent years more efforts to acquire systematic and empirical knowledge about these phenomenons.

The concept of crisis is often considered within or between states, therefore, it could be divided as a matter of either domestic policy or foreign policy. Of course, this is when located in the environment of politics and social studies, but originally the term comes from the medical studies, where crisis was defined by Georges Canguilhem as a “change heralded by some symptoms, occurring during an illness, through which the patient’s life will be saved or not”.
Concerning the perception of a crisis, in social relations between individuals these are considered chaotic situations that might be experienced at any point in life, and depending on which level, they can be more significant and urgent. The word crises means disorder, a condition that is not normal, common, or stable. It breaks the routine processes of any type of system.

Again, still a very broad and vague term, or as Warren Phillips and Richard Rimkunas describe it
“while the importance of crises in the international system is well understood, a clear understanding of what causes situations to be seen as crises has so far eluded students of the subject. (…) To a large extent, the explanation for this absence of theory rests with the confusion and vagueness surrounding the use of the term.”

In their work they also summarize two approaches to this definition:

- Substantive – the conception of crisis is definite to the content of a particular problem o situation.
- Procedural – the way in which crisis is understood is a much more general approach and aims towards general theory and not specific circumstances.

  However this particular division does not clarify the reasons of existence of crisis, its characteristics, etc..

  There is an urgent need to theorize these different approaches to international crises if we are to obtain meaningful cumulative understanding about them, so the definitional problem must be confronted.

  James M. McCormick also identifies two different approaches used by scholars to identify and create a useful definition.

1. Those researchers and investigators who define the concept from the decision-making perspective, therefore a crisis is understood in terms of the decision makers.
2. Those who define it in terms of the interaction process between nations.
   Concerning this first approach, the interpretation developed by Charles Hermann is the most representative:

   “Crisis is a situation that threatens the high-priority goals of the decision-making unit; restricts the amount of time available for response before the situation is transformed; and surprises the members of the decision-making unit when occurs.”

   The situation threatens their goals, it surprises them, and they are faced with short decision time.

   With respect to the second approach, in sharp and noticeable contrast, international crisis are situations in which there is a significant change in the normal interaction patterns between nations. McClelland and Young agree in this following definition:

   “An international crisis is a set of rapidly unfolding events which raises the impact of destabilizing forces in the general system or any of its subsystems substantially above normal or average levels, and increases the likelihood of violence occurring in the system.”

   As it can be seen, there are many approaches towards this complex word. And, because it is complex, usually there is no clear back and white answer, therefore, another approach towards the definition of international crises arises, in which a critical situation should be only labelled as such when the conditions of both approaches are satisfied.

   This article comprises the introduction of what an international crisis is, its context, and their process. It will be followed by other theoretical explanations and examples in order to achieve an empiric perspective that helps us understand such broad topic.

   Some recommended books to amplify and deepen the knowledge about these definitions and concepts are:
   The Concept of Crisis in International Politics – Warren Phillips
   The Western Political Quarterly – James M. McCormick.
