Conflict as a concept allows many definitions onto it, and it is a terminology that needs to be clearly defined in the context in which it is being used. 
In this particular situation we are going to focus on conflict as an object of social studies, because all branches of social science have something to say about conflict.
What are Social Sciences?
Social sciences are a group of academic disciplines dedicated to examining society. This branch of science studies how people interact with each other, behave, develop as a culture, and influence the world.
Among these branches we can find sociology, psychology, anthropology, economy, law, and communication.
Concerning sociology, Social conflict is the struggle for agency or power in society. Social conflict occurs when two or more actors oppose each other in social interaction, each exerts social power with reciprocity in an effort to achieve incompatible goals whilst preventing the other from attaining their own.
If we focus on psychology, conflict is reserved for the individual and the tensions with others and self, and if we focus on anthropology, the essence will lay on the origins of societal tensions, while in economy, the conflict arises in economic crises; and in the area of communication, miscommunications and the misunderstanding of messages.
Of course, concerning political science, which in this context can be defined as a social science which deals with systems of governance, and the analysis of political activities, political thoughts, and political behavior. There is a particular subdivision within it, where comparative politics are the ones in which they deal with conflict within the political system; and international relations, which deal with international conflicts in general, and among them we can highlight the security studies, such as war studies and peace studies.
Now, taking a look at conflict studies, they are considered a multi-level type of studies due to the fact that they entail relations between individuals, neighbours, ethnic groups, organizations, states, regions, and civilizations. It identifies and analyses violent and nonviolent behaviours as well as the structural mechanisms attending conflicts (including social conflicts), with a view towards understanding those processes which lead to a more desirable human condition. (Maire A. Dugan and Dennis P. Carey , “Towards a Definition of Peace Studies,” in Key Issues of Peace Research: Proceedings of the IPRA Ninth Conference, ed. Yoshikazu Sakamoto and Ruth Klaassen (Orillia, Ontario, Canada, 1981).
Conflict studies reveal the origins of different distinctions caused y boundaries, tensions, cleavages, and contradictions, as well as attributes such as perceptions, interests, views, norms, values; plus, the perception of war and violence is also a topic deeply analysed, and the legal aspects of conflict and their regulations.
