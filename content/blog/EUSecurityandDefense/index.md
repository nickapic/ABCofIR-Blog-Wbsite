The unity of the European continent has been neither an easy topic nor an easy path. To get to the point on which we are today, starting with the European Coal and Steel Community established by the Treaty of Paris in 1951 until the actual European Union we have today, many debates and treaties on economic, political and military terms have been created and discussed.

However, during the first years, the focus was not primarily on Common security and defence, but it has been one of the main objectives in the European programme over the years and several attempts have been made towards this aim.

Security is a basic necessity that needs to be covered, it is an imperative between the citizen and the state and without it nothing else could exist, no policies could be conducted, economy and politics would not function either. People need to be secured, protected, and feel that way to form and develop societies, states and an international community that looks for the worldwide implementation of human rights and allowing all to live with dignity. It all starts with security.

Right now the European Union is considered a political and economic union, so the focus, as we can see, has always been in the created internal single market and the system of laws applicable to all member states. Nowadays, this centre of interest has shifted; security is a main concern and target for the European Union. Cooperation in security is necessary if the borders of our countries are open, if our relationship among countries and our sense of belonging is growing. As a union, security should be shared and combined.

The European Union is a global united actor that is perceived around the world as a consistent and congruent bloc. Taking this affirmation into account, the European Union should have the adequate and necessary military capacities to perform as said global actor facing threats along with other countries and organizations.

The place to start is the Common Foreign and Security Policy, which is the organised foreign policy that the European Union has agreed on for their security and defence projects and activities. Although the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is the one in charge of the territorial defence of the European continent, since 1999 the European Union is able to create and implement peacekeeping missions and policing treaties, therefore having more capabilities and responsibilities in a more independent manner. The Berlin Plus agreement comprises several agreements on the relationship of the European Union and NATO. Created in 2002, it was the treaty that allowed that explained independence, and we have several examples, like the Operation Concordia in the former Yugoslavia, when the EU took over NATO’s action.

It was the Maastricht Treaty or the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) that encompassed the Common Foreign and Security Policy in 1992 and in 2009 it was strengthened by the Treaty of Lisbon. The European Union foreign and security policy looks for the preservation of peace, the strengthening of international security, the promotion of international cooperation, and the development and consolidation of democracy and respect for human rights. Due to the fact that the European Union does not have an army on its own, it relies on ad hoc forces that are provided by the member states for several types of intervention, such as humanitarian operations, conflict prevention, peacekeeping and post-conflict stabilization.

The Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), which was formerly known as the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP), which was as well the successor of the European Security and Defence Identity under NATO jurisdiction, is one of the most important elements of the Common Foreign and Security Policy.

It covers the defence and military aspects and also the civilian crisis management element of the European Union. Currently, its High Representative is Federica Mogherini, who presented the Implementation Plan on Security and Defence in June 2016.

This said Plan sets out a proposal to implement the EU Global Strategy and turn it into action. There are three core tasks, responding to external conflicts and crises when they arise, building the capacities of partners and protecting the European Union and its citizens through external action, and to accomplish these aims the Common Security and Defence Possibility will be used.

Continuing with the CSDP, which is a vital tool used in foreign policy, it gives the Union the possibility to intervene outside its borders for civilian crisis management missions and operations to achieve peace-keeping, the strengthening of international security and to prevent conflicts as well.

It was not created out of the blue, as earlier efforts for common security were made after the Second World War. In 1947 the Treaty of Dunkirk was the first European Alliance of mutual assistance after the conflict, and it was also used in the Treaty of Brussels for the Benelux countries. The Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on mutual defence was as well based on that first treaty.

Then there are several failures towards that sought military and defence union; for example the European Defence Community in 1950, whose aim was to create a European defence force to oppose to the Soviet Bloc, but it failed to obtain the ratification in the French Parliament.

In 1961 the President of the French Republic proposed a plan called Fouchet Plan, to design Europe at that time, and form a new Union of States constructed by the directorate of France, Britain and the United States. The plan could not work because other European Communities were more successful.

In 1992 Western European Union embraced the Petersberg tasks, which are defined as a list of military and security priorities for the ESDP in order to manage Eastern Europe and its instable situation. There was no army either, but cooperation between the member states was possible to achieve its responsibilities which included humanitarian and rescue actions, peacekeeping and peacemaking operations.

The said Amsterdam Treaty included the Peterberg Tasks in the European Union.
In 2003 a very important policy document was approved by the European Council, which is the European Security Strategy, whose headline says “A secure Europe in a better world”. It was created by the EU High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, Javier Solana. It can be considered equivalent to the National Security Strategy of the United States.

This report affirms that in the globalised world on which we live in, multilateralism and cooperation among states, European and overseas, are crucial due to the complexity of current threats and challenges such as terrorism, conflicts, civil wars, organised crimes, nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. Security in the present world is complicated and intricate, that is why many nations working as one in unity is mutually urgent and unavoidable.

The next document that came out regarding such topics was in 2008 and it was called the Report of the Implementation of the European Security Strategy: Providing security in a Changing World.

Since 2003 the European Union has carried out around 30 civilian missions and military operations responding to crises such as the situation after the tsunami in Indonesia with peace-building operations, the protection of refugees in Mali and the Central African Republic and fighting piracy in the Horn of Africa.

The first mission for European troops under the ESDP after 199 was in 2003 as well, in the Republic of Macedonia.

That same year the deployment of troops in the Democratic Republic of Congo, under the UN Security Council Resolution 1484, was necessary to prevent more violence and barbarity.

After all that history of developing security and defence in Europe, the unity is not as strong and cohesive as it could, and there is a clear lack of a truly European defensive pillar. Cooperation is preferred before nothing, but real combination and centralization is desired to act as a global actor with effectiveness and efficiency, or lack of consensus in certain conflicts could prove that there is room to improve and grow, like for example the Iraq conflict, where these absence of unity was clear, and it did not allow the European Union to work and produce as much results as it is possible.

The European Union has worked to be a union in all senses step by step; first, the economic union was completed and even though the crisis of 2008 restricted its growth, it is still working and members are in the process of recuperation due to that step further than cooperating. Political union is working, even though a more centralized cohesion in sought by many and hated by others, there is still time in between the present and “the United States of Europe”.

Security and defence is the next stage to ameliorate and improve, following this path the changes will be remarkable and a more profound unity and understanding between states will bring us closer. This topic is very necessary nowadays due to the different challenges and threats that this world faces and the European Union needs to be prepared to work with others, help and protect its citizens, in order to create a more peaceful and secure world for all.
