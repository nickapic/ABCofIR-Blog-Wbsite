Following the previous article, this particular one is about a safety issue as well, being analysed applying the multiactor and multilevel perspectives. Both of these will be explained in detail on upcoming articles.

The Hurricane Katrina was the costliest tropical cyclone on record, particularly on New Orleans, city which suffered the most of its impact. There is an estimated number of deaths that occurred due to this situation, an astonishing number of 1200. Plus it kept hitting record after record: the third major hurricane of 2005 Atlantic Hurricane season, and the fourth most intense Atlantic Hurricane on record.

Concerning the timeline, on the 23rd of August 2005 the National Hurricane Centre in Miami issues the first advisory about this particular tropical system, which was the twelfth tropical depression of the season and it formed in the Bahamas. The next day, the 24th, the storm is given a name, Katrina, which was the eleventh named storm of 2005; and a day later, it becomes a Category One hurricane with winds up to 120 km per hour. On the 26th the governors of Louisiana and Mississippi declare the state of emergency respectively on each state, and barely 24 hours after that the hurricane becomes of Category Three, with winds up to 185 km per hour. When it became a Category Four Hurricane, on the 28th of August, the New Orleans mayor stated the mandatory evacuation of the city, and that same day it went up a category in less than 24 hours.

The National Hurricane Centre issues a statement warning of a potential catastrophe. Barely a day afterwards, New Orleans starts to flood. The 30th of August a public health emergency is declared on the states of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. On the 31st New Orleans mayor issues a desperate SOS for help to the federal government, and a day after the US National Guard troops were sent to help and a budget of 10.5 billion dollars was approved by the Congress, and approved by the President, in this historical context, Bush.

Concerning the different levels of governance that can be seen in this particular disaster, it is important to highlight first the national level, as this particular issue mainly affected the United States, and therefore one of the first cohesive responses was at the national level.

However, letâ€™s analyse it step by step. Regarding preparations for this event, the national level is important as the US Coast Guard prepositioned resources and prepared in case they needed to act plus the government asked their personnel to move and evacuate even before the mandatory evacuation above mentioned. This mandatory evacuation was done at a local level, where the local state government was the one to ask for it, and therefore a second level of governance is found here.

However we need to highlight the fact that there was not a cohesive preparation for the whole country at a national level being only a few states the ones affected by it and that the system of the US is a federal system with much room to organize and dictate for themselves. Now, responding to this event, there is a clear national response with the National Response Plan, or FEMA as a few examples of the national government as a main level of governance.

There was a major international response with around 70 countries aiding with monetary donations and assistance, it is interesting to highlight that Cuba and Venezuela were the first states to help. This makes the international level very clear as well, plus, at the local level some individuals acting as volunteers as for example the Amateur Radio Emergency Service.

After this analysis it is the turn of the relevant actors. In order to prepare for the disaster there are many actors that contributed, many being government actors such as the US Coast Guard, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the National Hurricane Centre, all giving information and preparing for the worst case scenario. There are also plenty of societal actors like individuals starting to evacuate voluntarily, which prevented many deaths, and politicians as the President and the governors of the affected states.

Lastly, concerning the response actors for this particular event, there are many governmental actors such as the own American Government and other states governments, or the National Response Plan, plus the Coast Guard rescuing people. Many NGOs such as American Red Cross as an example even though there are many more, and societal actors such as volunteers.

In conclusion, this was a disaster in which we can appreciate the multilevel perspective for security and safety, as well as the multi-actor perspective. We can find a comprehensive overview of the various levels of governance involved in this case plus a comprehensive overview of the most relevant actors involved.
